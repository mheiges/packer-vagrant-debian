For DEB package building:

apt-get install 
  devscripts
  dpkg-dev
  build-essential
  mlocate
  apache2

Rebuild a package from source

mkdir apache2
cd !$
apt-get source apache2

Install build dependencies (the -r removes the build-deps deb package after installing, so it does not interfere with the build)
yes | sudo mk-build-deps -i -r

Build
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

(or `debuild` which also attempts to sign)
